👋🏽 Hi, I’m Tawsif — PM instincts, engineer execution.  

I design systems with **production constraints and end users in mind from day one** —  
especially when scale, reliability, or clarity actually matter.

## 🔭 What I’m Working On

- **Alana – Product Ingestion & Classification**  
  Designing the ingestion + classification layer for Alana’s product data platform — deterministic product IDs, taxonomy-based bucket mapping, and plans for multi-threaded imports and AI-assisted classification.

- **PLASMA Lab – ChatDBG (NSF-funded LLM debugger)**  
  Software Engineering Research Assistant under Prof. Emery Berger, helping build the next-generation **VS Code extension for ChatDBG** and hardening the underlying debugger tooling.

- **Kormo Mela – Founder & Full-Stack Architect**  
  A verified service-provider marketplace (drivers, housekeepers, etc.) with a FastAPI + Go backend, React Native apps, Postgres/PostGIS, Redis, and Stripe-based escrow flows.

- **Platform / Infra Projects**  
  - [`api-gateway-auth-service`](https://github.com/tawsifazad23/api-gateway-auth-service) – .NET 8 gateway with JWT auth, RBAC, and config-driven routing.  
  - [`otel-observability-template`](https://github.com/tawsifazad23/otel-observability-template) – OpenTelemetry + Prometheus + Grafana template for tracing/metrics/logs across services.  
  - [`developer-tooling-cli`](https://github.com/tawsifazad23/developer-tooling-cli) – TypeScript CLI for validating and linting OpenAPI/YAML specs, inspired by my work at Verizon.

## 💼 Experience (Snapshot)

- **Software Engineer Intern – Alana**  
  Backend + data platform work for product ingestion and taxonomy-based classification.

- **Software Engineering Research Assistant – PLASMA Lab, UMass Amherst**  
  Contributing to **ChatDBG**, an AI-augmented debugger (ACM FSE ’25), and leading work on its VS Code extension.

- **Full-Stack Software Developer Co-op – Verizon**  
  Built a TypeScript-based API governance toolchain used by internal teams, integrating with AWS Lambda/S3 and CI/CD to make API compliance fast and repeatable. Also prototyped deepfake-aware voice authentication concepts.

- **Full-Stack Software Engineer Intern – Bondstein**  
  Go + PostgreSQL microservices for IoT fleet tracking (≈1M+ telemetry events/day), with Redis caching and Dockerized deploys.
